# Enable Powercord Labs

A very simple [Powercord](https://powercord.dev) plugin to enable the old Labs (experiments) feature, which is currently disabled by default but can be reenabled since it's still in Powercord's code. The experiments in the Labs tab now don't actually do much except making your client more likely to crash or logging messages about your cat being fat to the console, so the usefulness of this is limited at best.

This repository's name begins with "0" to put the Labs tab in your Discord settings above the rest of your plugins' settings, immediately below General Settings, Plugins, Themes, and Updater.
